We have been asked to create a network of docking stations and public bikes.  The program will run all the docking stations, simulate all the bikes and emulate all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff etc)

We're getting paid a mint!!

This is Tom and Chris' solution to the Boris Bikes challenge from Week 1 of Makers Academy.
